# ðŸ“’ Address Book API

A high-performance, full-text searchable **Address Book service** built with [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/).  
It supports inserting, querying, updating, and deleting contacts via REST endpoints â€” with **substring-based search** using an inverted index.

We currently have two implementations:
- **FullTokenizationImpl**:
  - Uses a full substring search on `name`, `email`, and `phone`
  - Implements an in-memory inverted index for fast lookups
- **KGramAndInvertedIndexingImpl**:
  - Uses K-Gram tokenization for substring search with max substring length of 10
  - Implements an in-memory inverted index for fast lookups
- **HybridImpl**:
  - Combines both partial tokenization and K-Gram indexing for maximum flexibility
  - Uses an in-memory inverted index for fast lookups
